# Energy-Generator
The Bicycle Pedal Energy Generator is a simple and eco-friendly system that converts human mechanical energy into electrical energy
In this project, electrical power is generated by pedaling a bicycle, where the rotational motion of the pedal is transmitted to a generator through a chain and sprocket or belt mechanism. The generated electrical energy is then rectified, regulated, and stored in a battery for later use.
This system can be used to power low-energy devices such as LED lights, mobile chargers, or small electronic equipment. The project demonstrates the practical application of energy conversion principles and highlights the potential of human-powered energy systems as a sustainable solution in areas with limited electricity supply. The bicycle pedal energy generator is cost-effective, easy to operate, environmentally friendly, and promotes physical fitness along with energy awareness. This mini project is particularly suitable for educational institutions to understand renewable energy concepts and power generation using non-conventional sources.
